            <p>Business Investment Group is the first club dedicated entirely to the world of investment! Although many think of stocks as the sole form of investment, we intend to help members realize the potential gains in many of types of less known securities such as options and bonds. Both inside and outside of meetings, we'll be learning strategies used by "the pros" on Wall Street and exploring a career in investment banking. Members will have the opportunity to not only participate in intra-school stock competitions but also have a chance to tour local investment firms and hedge funds while leveraging a combined 30 years of investment experience in the officer team.</p>
            
            <p><b>Officer Team: </b>President: Joshua Soong, Vice President of Competitions: Harrison Wang, Vice President of Operations: Luca Popescu, Secretary-Treasuer: Michael Zhang</p>
