            <h1>Character Design Club</h1>
            <h2>Wednesday lunches | <span>Room 70</span></h2>
            
            <p>The purpose of the Character Design Club is to provide a community and learning environment for students of all skill levels with an interest in drawing and creating characters. Officers put together presentations for members on various aspects of character design, techniques, and working artists in the field/related fields. Tutorials on drawing techniques are sometimes presented by the officers as well. Members are also encouraged to participate in the many themed character designing contests over the course of the year. Other activities that take place during club meetings include figure drawing sessions and games such as pictionary.</p>
