            <p>"Our club's main purpose/goal is to promote the game of chess and at the same time learn it to a greater extent. In this club, members will be taught various chess openings, middlegames/tactics, and endgame theory.  They will also learn different types of positions such as the “Greek Gift Sacrifice.” As they learn more of these basic principles and apply them in a strategic manner, they will definitely improve their critical thinking skills not only in chess, but similar situations.  Not only does this club promote interest for chess, but it also allows people with similar interests to interact with each other. Also, our purpose is to just not teach, but to play chess games and have fun with experimenting with different moves. Most importantly, there will be competitions to participate in and a great opportunity to compete with other students from other schools.  In local, state, or national tournaments, students have the ability to demonstrate their knowledge of mostly tactics and vigorous moves.  Depending on their performance, their USCF (United States Chess Federation) rating will either increase, decrease, or stay the same.  Finally, our main purposes are to train students to go to tournaments, help them perceive chess more as a strategical/aggressive game, and lastly, to help ourselves learn deeper concepts while teaching.</p>
