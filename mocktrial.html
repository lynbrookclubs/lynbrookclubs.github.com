            <h2>Tuesdays and Thursdays, 6:30pm-8:30pm | <span>Rm 609</span></h2>
            
            <p>"A competition of teams across the state present the prosecution and defense sides of a criminal case. With a new case every year, mock trial deals with hard-hitting issues such as homicide and grand larceny. Students compete as specific roles in the courtroom, from lawyers to witnesses to clerks. Each school serves as either prosecution or defense, and individual teams are scored by real lawyers/judges on legal knowledge, presentation, and courtroom dominance. The team with the most points wins the trial, and progresses to the next level.
