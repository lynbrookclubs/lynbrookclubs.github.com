            <h2>Wednesday Brunches | <span>Room 002</span></h2>
            
            <p>The Lynbrook Red Cross blends volunteering, certifications, and fun socials for an all around awesome club!  Members have the opportunity to volunteer at small and large events, such as senior center visits and even helping out at major Red Cross parades and exhibitions.  In addition, members can connect with the chapter to participate in committees that teach skills like CPR.  Finally, Lynbrook Red Cross is a great way to meet new people from Lynbrook and other schools in the area through not only volunteering, but chapter wide socials that include ice skating and movie nights.</p>
