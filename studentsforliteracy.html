Lynbrookâ€™s Students For Literacy club aims to promote the love of reading within the Lynbrook school community by organizing interesting club meetings (i.e. book discussions, poetry readings, and creative writing) and book matching events in which students receive a book based on their responses to an interest survey. The club also spreads the importance of reading outside the school community through volunteer reading sessions and writing workshops. The goal of this club is to encourage people with any socioeconomic status to empower themselves through reading.             </p>
