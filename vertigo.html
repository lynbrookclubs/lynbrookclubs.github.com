            <p>Vertigo is the official literary magazine of Lynbrook High School. Established in 1995, the magazine continues to encourage widespread appreciation for and interest in creative writing and art. At the beginning of each school year, the edit board reviews student applications to select its inspired staff. Through exercises and workshops, writers develop distinct voices that are published in that yearâ€™s issues of the magazine. Students may also apply for the Vertigo art team, which produces illustrations and photographs to complement the prose and poetry. The annual print issue, which is distributed for free, tangibly presents the efforts of talented Lynbrook writers and artists for the rest of the community to enjoy. Vertigo also releases three web issues throughout the year. </p>
